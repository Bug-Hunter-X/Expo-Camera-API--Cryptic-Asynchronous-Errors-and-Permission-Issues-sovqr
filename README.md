# Expo Camera API Debugging Guide: Addressing Asynchronous Errors and Permission Issues

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive issue encountered when working with the Expo Camera API. The problem involves cryptic error messages arising from mishandling asynchronous operations and camera permissions.

The `cameraBug.js` file showcases the problematic code, exhibiting improper handling of promises or async/await. This leads to unexpected behavior, such as application crashes or the camera failing to function correctly.

The solution, presented in `cameraBugSolution.js`, addresses these issues by implementing proper asynchronous handling techniques and robust permission checks. Detailed explanations are provided within the code itself.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Execute `expo start`.
5. Observe the error behavior.

## Understanding the Solution

The solution file meticulously demonstrates how to resolve the issue by correctly handling asynchronous operations and validating camera permissions.  This involves ensuring that all necessary asynchronous operations complete before attempting to access camera data.  Permission checks are implemented to prevent attempts to access the camera without the user's consent.

## Learning Outcomes

This example offers valuable insights into debugging asynchronous code within a React Native environment using Expo. It highlights the importance of proper error handling and permission management when dealing with hardware-dependent features like the camera.
